                <h2>Origin:</h2>
                <p>While it had been a mystery for quite some time where the domestic house cat originated from, scientists believe to have found the 
                answer. In 1983, one of the earliest discoveries of domestic cat remains was unearthed in Cyprus, an island in the Middle East. The 
                remains consisted of a jawbone, and were believed to be about 9,000 years old. It has been determined that all domesticated cats come 
                from the wildcat of the Middle East, <em>felix sylvestris lybica</em>. Over thousands of years of evolution, the wildcat became
                 <em>felis catus</em>, the domestic house cat of today.</p>

            <h3>Life with Humans:</h3>
                <p>During the transition to <em>felis catus</em>, humans took interest in them for their rodent hunting abilities and kept them around
                for free pest control. In 2001, during the excavation of 9,500 year old human bones, cat remains were
                discovered buried alongside the human at the same depth. Around 3,000 years ago in Egypt, cats were worshiped by humans and it was common
                practice to be buried together.<blockquote><em>"In lieu of finding a bell around its neck, this is about as solid evidence as 
                one can have that cats held a special place in the lives and afterlives of residents of this site." </em> <cite>-Melinda Zeder, Smithsonian Museum Zoologist</cite> </blockquote> 
                 It was not until the 1920s that it became popular to have cats roam in and out of peoples homes in North America.
                This was largely influenced by US President Coolidge and his cats, who had free access in and out of the White House. Then in 1947, clay 
                cat litter was invented by Ed Lowe, causing a spike in the popularity of cats as indoor companions. No longer were they
                seen as a just a convenience around the house and farm for rats! It is often said that cats domesticated themselves as humans did not
                breed them for an intended purpose.</p>

                <h4>Breeds, Colors and Markings:</h4>
                <p>While there are multiple types of purebred cats, Siamese, Persian, Ragdoll, etc, the most common breeds of cats are domestic-short-hairs (DSH) and
                domestic-long-hairs (DLH). Some people specifically breed cats for a certain appearance, but the average cat on the street is usually
                a DSH or DLH. 
                Tabby cats are not a breed but a coat pattern. Tabbies, also called, are characterized by stripes on their body and can be brown, gray or orange.
                The agouti gene is responsible for creating these stripes, referred to as "banding". Cats can have this gene even if you cannot see them, i.e. solid 
                colored cats. There are different styles of stripe patterns, including the classic tabby, mackerel tabby and spotted tabby. 
                When it comes to color, genetics also play a major role. Male cats cannot be both black and orange color as these colors are linked to the X chromosome. Therefore, if you see 
                a cat that is orange and black, it is automatically female! The two commonly known breeds of these cats are <strong>calico</strong> and 
                <strong>tortishell</strong>.</p>
