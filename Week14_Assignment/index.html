                    <p> Pusheen is a tubby tabby cat who brings smiles and laughter to people all around the world.
                    She became famous through her animated comics and GIFs posted on Pusheen.com,
                    as well as through her widely used animated stickers on Facebook, Instagram, iMessage, and other platforms.
                    On the official Pusheen website (Pusheen.com), Pusheen is described as being a female fictional cat who loves blogging, snacking, 
                    and going on adventures. Pusheen's name stems from the word puisín, which means kitten in Irish.
                    Pusheen has a mom named Sunflower, a dad named Biscuit, a sister named Stormy, a brother named Pip, 
                    and an array of furry friends, including Sloth the sloth, Bo the parakeet, and Cheek the hamster. </p> 

                    <p> Pusheen first appeared in May 2010 in the comic strip Pusheen Things on Claire Belton and Andrew Duff's website, Everyday Cute. Belton is an 
                    illustrator and entrepreneur, best known for creating Pusheen, along with several related cartoon characters. 
                    She is president of Pusheen Corp in Chicago, Illinois. On February 18, 2025, Pusheen celebrated her 15th birthday.</p>

                    <p> Pusheen has expanded to take part in multiple social media platforms, including Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter. 
                    She also has many fan pages within the platforms, as well as blogs dedicated to celebrating the comic. 
                    Her popularity has allowed the Pusheen Corporation to create an app that is an expansion of the sticker collection 
                    that started on Facebook. Each social media account owned by Pusheen's creators has gained over a million followers. 
                    Due to this rise in popularity, the company has started releasing GIFs on its website several times a month.</p>
